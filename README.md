Spoff - Smart Phone Off
=====

Forget your phones - not your friends!

An app which aims preventing people in a social event from using their mobile devices.

Currently, Spoff runs on Android only, as our team only had a Android Hacker at the Yahoo Hack USA event.


Usage
-----

You can download the Android app from [here](http://umutgultepe.com). Once you get it, you can sign in with your YahooId

Go to a dinner with some friends. Proceed to create a table with a unique code. Make sure everybody coming to dinner gets Spoff and joins your table with the code you used.

After the dinner starts and everybody joins the table, no one should even look at their phones! You will know, because as soon as they unlock their phone, you will get a notification.
